<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>RXtoRINEX project is aimed to provide tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>To collect data from GPS / GNSS receivers embedded in mobile devices or connected to them through a serial port.</li>
<li>To analyze or print data collected</li>
<li>To convert data collected to RINEX or RTK formats</li>
<li>To read / filter / convert / write RINEX files</li>
</ul>

<p>RINEX is the standard format used to feed with observation and navigation data files software packages for computing positioning solutions with high accuracy.</p>

<p>RINEX data files are not aimed to compute solutions in real time, but to perform post-processing, that is, GNSS/GPS receiver data are first collected into files using the receiver specific format, then converted to standard RINEX data files, and finally processed using, may be, facilities having “number-crunching” capabilities, and additional data (like data from reference stations available in UNAVCO, EUREF, GDC, IGN, and other data repositories) to allow removal of receiver data errors.</p>

<p>A detailed definition of the RINEX format can be found in the document "RINEX: The Receiver Independent Exchange Format Version 2.10" from Werner Gurtner; Astronomical Institute; University of Berne. An updated document exists also for Version 3.00.</p>

<p>RTK refers here to the data format defined for the RTKLIB (<a href="http://www.rtklib.com/">http://www.rtklib.com/</a>) that would allow analysis of data collected with tools in this project using the RTKLIB.</p>

<p>Tools are provided at two levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++ classes that could be used by developers to implement their own tools. The most relevant are: RinexData to process RINEX data files; RTKobservation to generate RTK files; and OSPdata to acquire navigation and observation data from SiRF (TM) One Socket Protocol (OSP) records.</li>
<li>Commands to acquire OSP data from SiRF receivers, generate RINEX files from OSP data, convert and filter RINEX files, and other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="implementation-status" class="anchor" href="#implementation-status" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation status</h2>

<p>A first version of the package was released in February 2015.</p>

<p>The current version released in April 2016 includes improvements to allow reading / filtering / converting / writing RINEX files, process GLONASS data, better isolation between OSP data acquisition and RINEX generation.</p>

<p>The current implementation has the following scope:</p>

<ul>
<li>Binaries provided are for win32 environment.</li>
<li>GPS receivers shall be SiRF IV or V (TM) (for L1 signals) based, which should be able to provide OSP data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Future versions to include support for other receivers would depend on availability of information from manufacturers. Any information on ICDs for other receivers (like SiRFIV-t, Broadcom, etc) is welcome.</p>

<p>As future releases of Android would include classes and methods to allow access from Apps to the GNSS receiver raw data (<a href="http://gpsworld.com/google-to-provide-raw-gnss-measurements/">http://gpsworld.com/google-to-provide-raw-gnss-measurements/</a>), it is expected to include in this package tools to generate RINEX files from such raw data.</p>

<p>Future releases would provide versions for Linux and Android.</p>

<h2>
<a id="data-files" class="anchor" href="#data-files" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Files</h2>

<p>The data tools provided are used to process or generate the following file types.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rinex-observation" class="anchor" href="#rinex-observation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RINEX observation</h3>

<p>A RINEX observation file is a text file containing a header with data related to the file data acquisition, and sequences of epoch data. For each epoch the observables for each satellite tracked are included. See above reference on RINEX for a detailed description of this file format.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rinex-navigation" class="anchor" href="#rinex-navigation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RINEX navigation</h3>

<p>A RINEX navigation file is a text file containing a header with data related to the file data acquisition, and satellite ephemeris obtained from the navigation message transmitted inside the navigation satellite signal. See above reference on RINEX for a detailed description of this file format.</p>

<h3>
<a id="osp-binary" class="anchor" href="#osp-binary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OSP binary</h3>

<p>OSP binary are files containing OSP message data obtained from SiRF(TM) based GPS receivers. They can be embedded in the smartphone or connected to the computer or device through a serial port.</p>

<p>The file contains a sequence of OSP messages, where for each message they are stored the two bytes with the payload length and the n bytes of the message payload. The OSP binary file is simply the byte sequence of the transport message packet generated by the receiver after removing the bytes for "Start Sequence" (A0 A2), "Checksum" (2 bytes), and "End Sequence" (B0 B3).</p>

<p>A detailed definition of OSP messages can be found in the document "SiRFstarIV(TM) One Socket Protocol Interface Control Document".</p>

<h3>
<a id="gp2-debug" class="anchor" href="#gp2-debug" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GP2 debug</h3>

<p>GP2 debug are files containing receiver specific measurement data obtained in Android smartphones with embedded SiRFIV-T(TM) GPS receivers when DEBUGGING_FILES is set to 1 in the sirfgps.conf file.</p>

<p>They are text files containing in each line a time tag followed by an OSP message with byte contents written in hexadecimal.</p>

<p>Each line in the GP2 file has format as per the following example:</p>

<p>29/10/2014 20:31:08.942 (0) A0 A2 00 12 33 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 19 00 00 00 00 00 00 64 E1 01 97 B0 B3</p>

<p>Where:
       - Time tag: 29/10/2014 20:31:08.942
       - Unknown: (0) 
       - Head: A0 A2
       - Payload length: 00 12
       - Payload: 33 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 19 00 00 00 00 00 00 64 E1
       - Checksum: 01 97
       - Tail: B0 B3</p>

<p>Note that in above format, data from "head" to "tail" is an OSP messages with values written in hexadecimal.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pkt-messages" class="anchor" href="#pkt-messages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PKT messages</h3>

<p>Packet message files contain a sequence of binary OSP full messages. Each full message starts with the head (two bytes with values 0xA0 and 0xA2), following the payload length (a two byte integer), the payload bytes, a two bytes checksum, and finishing with the tail (two bytes with values 0xB0 and 0xB3). Between the tail of one message and the head of the following one it may be garbage data.</p>

<p>Such files may be captured directly through the serial port where the receiver is connected using for example a terminal emulator.</p>

<h3>
<a id="synchrorx" class="anchor" href="#synchrorx" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SynchroRX</h3>

<p>This command line program can be used to synchronize SiRF based receiver and computer to allow communication between both.</p>

<p>The receiver state is defined by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The serial port bit rate, stop bits, and parity being used by receiver</li>
<li>The protocol mode being used by receiver to send data: NMEA or OSP</li>
<li>If data is flowing from the receiver or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>The computer data acquisition process state is defined by:</p>

<ul>
<li>The port (port name) used for the communication with the GPS receiver</li>
<li>The serial port bit rate, stop bits, and parity being used</li>
<li>The type of data required: NMEA or OSP</li>
</ul>

<p>To allow communication between GPS receiver and computer, states of both elements shall be synchronized according to the needs stated.</p>

<p>Synchronization requires first to know the current state of receiver and computer port, and then change both to the new state. But, to know the receiver state is necessary to communicate with it, setting the computer port at the same speed, stop bits and parity that the receiver. This will allow receiving and analyzing the data being generated by the receiver to know the protocol it is using. As receiver state may be not known initially, it would be necessary to scan different communication alternatives to know it.</p>

<p>To allow synchronization it is assumed the following for the receiver:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is providing data continuously: ASCII NMEA or binary OSP messages, depending on the mode.</li>
<li>It is receiving/sending data at 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 38400, 57600 or 115200 bps, with one stop bit and parity set to none.</li>
</ul>

<p>After synchronization, bit rates will be set to 9600 bps when exchanging NMEA data or to 57600 bps when exchanging OSP messages.</p>

<p>The synchronization process can be controlled using options to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show usage data and stops</li>
<li>Set the log level (SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST)</li>
<li>Set the serial port name where receiver is connected</li>
<li>Set the receiver protocol to NMEA or OSP</li>
</ul>
